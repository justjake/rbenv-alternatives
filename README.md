# rbenv-alternatives

This plugin allow you to add Ruby interpreters available through the Debian
alternatives system into rbenv. This means you can install the different Ruby
interpreters through APT on Debian and derivative distributions, and switch
between them using rbenv.

The Ruby Ruby interpreters installed via APT will become available to use with
rbenv in addition to any other Ruby interpreter you may have compiled manually
(or installed into `~/.rbenv/versions` in any other way).

## Installation

Just copy `rbenv-alternatives` into any directory in your `$PATH`, after
installing and setting up rbenv itself.

If you install rbenv through APT, then it will already bring this plugin with
it:

    # apt-get install rbenv

## Usage
